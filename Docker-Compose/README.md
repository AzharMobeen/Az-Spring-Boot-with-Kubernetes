# Docker
When we have multiple application or microservices then it's very deficult to execute multiple commands to deploy multiple applications/microservices on different environments. For this purpose Docker Compose comes.

#### Check Docker Compose:
* If you have install docker on your machine then please run this command:

		docker-compose --version
* Usally it's install with Docker if not then [visit this link](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/)
